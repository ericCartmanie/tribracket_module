# Tribracket Module

## Overview
This is the code repository for the paper: **Alexander Enhancements of Tribracket Invariants** initiated by Sam Nelson, Professor at Claremont Mckenna College and Deanna Needell, Professor at UCLA. We welcome any editing and review **with proper attribution to our work**. We're actively looking for implementation of this project in another language (Either C, C++ or Matlab). Feel free to hit either of us if you want to contribute to the coding as well.  <br/>_Our paper is now on arXiv:<br/><br/>_
