# Tribracket Module

## Overview
This is the code repository for the paper: **Tribracket Modules** initiated by Sam Nelson, Professor at Claremont Mckenna College and Deanna Needell, Professor at UCLA. We welcome any editing and review **with proper attribution to our work**. Currently we adopt a brute-force approach/algorithm for finding these invariant instances, but we welcome any implementation of this project either with more efficient algorithms or in other programming languages. Hence Feel free to hit either of us if you want to contribute to this project as well. 

<br/>_Our paper is now on arXiv:<br/>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04421<br/>_
